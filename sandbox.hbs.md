# Access an experimental sandbox environment

This topic describes how you can access a hosted experimental Tanzu Application Platform
(formerly known as TAP) environment.

VMware provides an experimental developer sandbox that you can use for 8
hours.
Your sandbox session takes 2 minutes to start, though it can take up to 25 minutes.
The sandbox environment includes the following services:

- Spring Cloud Services: Application Config Service, Spring Cloud Gateway and AppSSO
- Data Services: PostgreSQL, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Kafka and MongoDB

## Procedure

1. Create a [VMware Customer Connect](https://customerconnect.vmware.com) account and log in to [Tanzu Academy](https://tanzu.academy/home).

2. Get started with your [developer sandbox](https://tanzu.academy/guides/developer-sandbox) in Tanzu Academy.
